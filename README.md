## Visual Music WebApp
An app that converts your favorite music pieces into visual expressions. 

Visual Music is a collaboration project managed by a group of dedicated fellow students. Aimed at all music and arts lovers, it provides the users with a real time visual transcription of a streamed music piece. 

If the visual transcription can be at first of random assignment of colors and shapes, it shouldn't remain so, as **one of the main interest is to transcribe the emotional effects of the music piece**. Therefore, questions will araise as perception is highly cultural and language induced. It might be interesting in a second time to create various themes based on those considerations for the visual transcription.

## Applications
The applications could be :
* the possibility to screen the visual expression as background for parties, concerts and stages, 
* accessibility, by giving a visual transcription of music pieces, making them accessible to the hearing impaired,
* creation of original objects, with the possibility of a screen capture going with a downloadable HD print file, the possibility of printing, framing and offering the painting of a song to friends and family,
* tool or interesting experiment for musicologists, linguists, scientists, etc.

## Technology/Stack:
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/): to design the UI
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/): to test and export the UI components for React
* [React](https://reactjs.org/): to build the UI
* [p5](https://p5js.org/): for visualization
   * using [react-p5-wrapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-p5-wrapper))
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)                 
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/): to build and test the deployed app
  
__Idea:__ We want to analyse the data from an uploaded mp3 song, and process it through p5.js. We are not building a player, and not building a simple visualizer: we want to think on how to transcribe the music in an artistic way - the emotions, patterns, etc. Challenges have to be solved but it could mean working on rhythms, beats, melodies, frequencies, loops, etc.
